As for bonus task 5,
Since the design is fairly simple, theres not much responsive design that I need to implement. Below are some of the things that are responsive:
1. The main navbar are responsive based on the user screen width. It changes to sheet component when its in mobile size.
2. The text in About and Home page are reduced to smaller size according to the screen width.

Like I said not much needed to be responsive as the design is fairly simple not much adjustment needed.
